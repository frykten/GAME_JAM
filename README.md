This is my entry to the Simplon Game Jam, some small contest of my school.

This is entirely parodic and isn't meant to offend anyone - or is it?

Most of the content is currently lost/pending due to the requirements of the contest: there is a card game add-on that should be coming once the jury is over.

N.B. : Yeah, at the moment there's a song made by Marilyn Manson. I put it to fuck with people who'll try the program. I do not own it.
